# Development Workflow

## Recommended Process

### 1. Build Components First
Create reusable UI elements in `src/components/`, following Atomic Design principles. 
*   **Validate in Storybook**: Ensure visual correctness and responsiveness before integrating them.
*   **Keep it Stateless**: Avoid heavy business logic in your atoms/molecules.

### 2. Implement Logic
Define valid business rules, API calls, and state management in `src/app/`.
*   **Services & Store**: Build the data layer independent of the UI.
*   **Hooks**: Encapuslate logic in custom hooks.

### 3. Connect & Assemble
Assemble components into pages and connect them to your logic layer.
*   **Page Views**: Create page-level components in `src/components/pages`.
*   **Routes**: Map these pages to URLs in `src/app/frontend/routes`.
