# React Template 2026

## Overview
This is a **foundational starter kit** utilizing a hybrid architecture designed for scalability and maintainability. It provides a solid baseline combining **Atomic Design** for UI components with a **Domain-Driven Orchestration** layer for application logic. 

**Note**: This structure is a recommendation to help projects scale. You are encouraged to adapt, extend, or simplify folders as your specific project requirements evolve.

### Core Principles
* **Clean Organization**: The `src` directory encourages keeping the root clean, organizing logic into clear sub-directories.
* **Separation of Concerns**: We recommend treating `components/` and `theme/` as your internal UI library, while `app/` handles the business logic and glue.

## Why a Template?

### Not a "Full Blown" Design System
This project intentionally does **not** ship with a library of pre-built UI components (like buttons, date molecules, or navigation headers).

**The Goal**: I wanted to create a robust **Base Template** that I can fork to kickoff *any* new application.

### Flexibility First
The architecture is designed to support any implementation method I choose for a specific project:
*   **Frameworks**: I can easily layer **MUI**, **Bootstrap**, or **Tailwind** on top of this structure.
*   **From Scratch**: The folder structure supports building custom components using raw **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and **HTML**.

### Custom WCAG Color Generator
While the component library is empty, I **did** include my own **Custom WCAG Color Generation Algorithm**.
*   **Standardization**: I plan to use this algorithmic approach to color accessibility in all my future apps.
*   **Evolution**: This engine serves as the source of truth for color, and we will update and refine the algorithm as needed for each specific project.
