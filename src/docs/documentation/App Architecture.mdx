# Application Architecture

## Default Directory Structure

### 1. `src/app/` (The Orchestration Layer)
The "Glue" of the application. This is where your features and business logic live.

#### `app/frontend/`
A comprehensive 7-folder convention to manage browser environments. Use what you need:
* **`bootstrap/`**: Entry points (e.g., `main.tsx`, providers setup).
* **`config/`**: Env vars and constants.
* **`providers/`**: Global Contexts.
* **`routes/`**: Routing configuration.
* **`services/`**: API clients, analytics, or other singletons.
* **`store/`**: State management (Zustand, Context, Redux).
* **`types/`**: Application-specific TS definitions.

#### `app/backend/` (Optional)
A placeholder structure for server-side logic, BFFs, or API mocking.
* **`api/`**, **`controllers/`**, **`db/`**, etc.: Standard backend patterns available for use if your project requires them.

### 2. `src/components/` (The UI Library)
Follows **Atomic Design** principles to keep components reusable and testable.
* **`atoms/`**, **`molecules/`**, **`organisms/`**: Building blocks of increasing complexity.
* **`templates/`**: Page layouts.
* **`pages/`**: Top-level views connected to routes.

### 3. `src/theme/`
Your centralized Design System tokens (colors, spacing, typography).

### 4. `src/docs/`
Documentation, Storybook configuration, and guides.
