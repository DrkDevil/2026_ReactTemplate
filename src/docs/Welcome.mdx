# React Template Architecture

## Overview
This is a **foundational starter kit** utilizing a hybrid architecture designed for scalability and maintainability. It provides a solid baseline combining **Atomic Design** for UI components with a **Domain-Driven Orchestration** layer for application logic. 

**Note**: This structure is a recommendation to help projects scale. You are encouraged to adapt, extend, or simplify folders as your specific project requirements evolve.

### Core Principles
* **Clean Organization**: The `src` directory encourages keeping the root clean, organizing logic into clear sub-directories.
* **Separation of Concerns**: We recommend treating `components/` and `theme/` as your internal UI library, while `app/` handles the business logic and glue.
* **Encapsulation**: Keeping Frontend and Backend (if applicable) logic distinct helps prevent tight coupling, but these boundaries can be adjusted based on your architecture (e.g., BFF, Server Actions, or pure Client-Side).

## Default Directory Structure

### 1. `src/app/` (The Orchestration Layer)
The "Glue" of the application. This is where your features and business logic live.

#### `app/frontend/`
A comprehensive 7-folder convention to manage browser environments. Use what you need:
* **`bootstrap/`**: Entry points (e.g., `main.tsx`, providers setup).
* **`config/`**: Env vars and constants.
* **`providers/`**: Global Contexts.
* **`routes/`**: Routing configuration.
* **`services/`**: API clients, analytics, or other singletons.
* **`store/`**: State management (Zustand, Context, Redux).
* **`types/`**: Application-specific TS definitions.

#### `app/backend/` (Optional)
A placeholder structure for server-side logic, BFFs, or API mocking.
* **`api/`**, **`controllers/`**, **`db/`**, etc.: Standard backend patterns available for use if your project requires them.

### 2. `src/components/` (The UI Library)
Follows **Atomic Design** principles to keep components reusable and testable.
* **`atoms/`**, **`molecules/`**, **`organisms/`**: Building blocks of increasing complexity.
* **`templates/`**: Page layouts.
* **`pages/`**: Top-level views connected to routes.

### 3. `src/theme/`
Your centralized Design System tokens (colors, spacing, typography).

### 4. `src/docs/`
Documentation, Storybook configuration, and guides.

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Build Components**: Create reusable UI elements in `src/components/`, validating them here in Storybook.
2. **Implement Logic**: Define valid business rules and state in `src/app/`.
3. **Connect**: Assemble components into pages and connect them to your logic.
