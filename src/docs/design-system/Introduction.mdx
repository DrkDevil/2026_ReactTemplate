# Design System

Welcome to our **Design System**.

This library contains the atomic building blocks of our application's UI. These components are designed to be composable, reusable, and strictly typed.

## Atomic Structure
* **Atoms**: Buttons, Inputs, Icons...
* **Molecules**: Form Fields, Cards, Headers...
* **Organisms**: Complex self-contained sections.

---
*Use these primitives to construct features in the Application layer.*
