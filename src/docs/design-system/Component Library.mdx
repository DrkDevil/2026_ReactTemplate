# Component Library

## A Flexible Starting Point
This Design System is provided as a **minimalist, unopinionated base**. It is not a rigid requirement, but a structured starting point for your own visual language.

### Extend or Replace
*   **Vanilla Core**: We ship with standard CSS/SCSS modules for maximum control.
*   **Framework Ready**: You can easily layer **Tailwind**, **MUI**, or **Mantine** on top of this structure.
*   **Build Your Own (Empty Frame)**: This template ships with **no pre-built components**, giving you a clean slate. You simply build what you need in `src/components/`, ensuring your project isn't bloated with unused library code.

### Features
*   **Atomic Architecture**: Components are organized by complexity (Atoms -> Molecules -> Organisms).
*   **Custom Color System**: Includes a sophisticated color ramping tool and transparency handling (see *Visual Language*).
*   **Strict Typing**: All components are fully typed with TypeScript.

---
*This system is designed to be adapted. Change the tokens, swap the engines, and make it yours.*
